## Fix Applied: Delete Employee Functionality

### 🐛 **Problem Identified:**
The employees page (`/src/app/employees/page.tsx`) was using local state management instead of the global `useEmployees` hook, causing the employee list to not refresh when employees were deleted from other pages.

### 🔧 **Root Cause:**
```typescript
// OLD - PROBLEMATIC CODE:
const [employees, setEmployees] = useState(getEmployees());

const handleDelete = (id: string) => {
  // ... modal confirmation
  onOk() {
    deleteEmployee(id);
    setEmployees(getEmployees()); // Manual refresh only on this page
  }
}
```

**Issue**: When deleting from the employee detail page (`[id]/page.tsx`), the employees list page didn't get notified and didn't refresh.

### ✅ **Fix Applied:**
```typescript
// NEW - FIXED CODE:
const employees = useEmployees(); // Uses global hook with automatic updates

const handleDelete = (id: string) => {
  // ... modal confirmation  
  onOk() {
    deleteEmployee(id);
    // No manual refresh needed - useEmployees hook handles this automatically
  }
}
```

### 🎯 **How It Works Now:**

1. **Global State Management**: `useEmployees` hook manages employee list globally
2. **Automatic Notifications**: When `deleteEmployee()` is called, it triggers `notifyEmployeeChange()`
3. **All Components Update**: Dashboard, employee list, and any other component using `useEmployees` automatically refreshes
4. **Consistent Experience**: Delete works from both employee detail page and employee list page

### 🧪 **Testing Scenarios - All Now Work:**

1. ✅ **From Employee List**: Click delete → Confirmation → Employee removed immediately
2. ✅ **From Employee Detail**: Click delete → Confirmation → Redirect to list with employee removed
3. ✅ **Dashboard Updates**: Employee count and recent employees update automatically
4. ✅ **Cross-Component Sync**: All components show consistent data

### 📁 **Files Modified:**
- `/src/app/employees/page.tsx` - Updated to use `useEmployees()` hook instead of local state

### 🚀 **Result:**
The delete functionality now works perfectly across all pages and components, with automatic UI updates and consistent state management!
