0%   â†’ opacity: 1, transform: translateX(0) scale(1)
50%  â†’ opacity: 0, transform: translateX(-20px) scale(0.95)  
100% â†’ opacity: 0, transform: translateX(-50px) scale(0.9), height: 0
```

```

### ðŸ”§ **Implementation Details:**

#### **State Management:**
- `deletingIds` Set tracks which rows are currently animating
- `isDeleting` boolean for detail page animation state
- `rowClassName` dynamically applies animation CSS classes

#### **Timing Coordination:**
- CSS animation duration matches JavaScript setTimeout delays
- Animation completes before data removal for smooth effect
- Success message timing coordinated with navigation

#### **Performance Optimizations:**
- `pointer-events: none` during animation prevents user interaction
- `useCallback` for delete handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Smooth transitions only on non-deleting rows to avoid conflicts

### ðŸŽª **Additional Polish:**

- Table rows lift slightly on hover with subtle shadow
- Delete buttons scale up on hover with red background tint
